Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives
-----------------------------------------------------

The tools and techniques in this library will be
a result of me working through "Options, Futures, 
and Other Derivatives" by John C. Hull.

I will be working through the textbook chapter
by chapter, gradually evolving this library
into something useful.

### Note

In order for some functionality to work,
you need to create an account and get an
`auth_token` from Quandl. Then, create
an `auth.py` inside of `lib` which looks
like the following:

    AUTH_TOKEN = 'fjd83JDN8'
